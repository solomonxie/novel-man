# Which App Store this build is for. `STOREFRONT=CHN` (or CN, or CHINA) builds
# what the China store gets: only the AI vendors filed there, no drawing, and
# Chinese as the opening language. `STORE=china` means the same thing.
#
# It installs over the same bundle id, so iOS treats it as an upgrade and the
# app's Documents — the library, the covers, the manuscripts — are untouched.
# Nothing in the China build deletes anything either: the vendor list only
# governs what is *offered*, so keys already stored stay stored.
#
# The value is written into src/store/override.ts for the build and put back
# straight after, so the tree never says one thing while the installed app
# does another, and nothing switchable ever reaches a reviewer.
